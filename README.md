# Code-Quiz
Timed coding quiz with multiple choice questions. It runs in the browser and features HTML, CSS, and Javascript code.
Assistance with the Javascript functions was learned from Sophia(TA), especially when utilizing for-each statements.
Further Javascript function help was attained through group discussion with my peers.
Sample questions provided by the challenge mock-up.
