# Code-Quiz
Timed coding quiz with multiple choice questions. It runs in the browser and features HTML, CSS, and Javascript code.
Assistance with the Javascript functions was learned from Sophia(TA), especially when utilizing for-each statements.
Further Javascript function help was attained through group discussion with my peers.
I was unable to fix a bug which ended the quiz at question #4, and therefore unable to add a working highscore list.
Sample questions provided by the challenge mock-up.
